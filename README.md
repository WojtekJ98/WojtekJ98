## Hi ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Wojtek
I am an aspiring Junior Front-End Developer with a passion for creating user-friendly web applications. I am expanding my knowledge of front-end technologies so that I can start working to gain commercial experience. Currently, I am mainly focused on learning TypeScript and React. 

### What I'm Working On ðŸŒ±
- Expanding my knowledge of the TypeScript language.
- Learning advanced front-end concepts such as state management using Redux.
- After mastering these skills, will build Kanban applications to practice state management and user account functions.

### My projects ðŸŽ¯
Run Boy E-commerce app which is an e-commerce application that consists of two components. One for database management. In it you can add new products, edit products already added to the database or create a product category with custom properties.  The other is already front-end part of the store, where the user can view products and filter them by categories. In addition, user can create an account and log in. After logging in, the user can add products to the shopping cart or to favorites and go to the order that Stripe handles. The user can see his orders in his account page.
